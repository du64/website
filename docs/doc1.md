Welcome to my docublog (documentation blog)! This is a developer-orientated blog that also will have my thoughts, ideas, concepts, and other neat stuff in the sidebar on the left.

### About Me

My name is Du Cheng, I'm a software developer, privacy and [FOSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software) advocate, I run a business, and currently I manage data flow between servers and control access.

I started my developer journey when I was 10 years old on a Windows XP system, and started writing programs and very basic websites. At age 13 I got into Linux and started following tutorials to learn the terminal, get a web server up, and I started hosting my own web content. This eventually grew into me hosting (very basic) websites for other people.

I wasn't satisfied with the government being able to control or take my hardware, or my Internet Service Provider being able to shut down my connection over my ideas and the things I wrote, so I did my research, and got into federated and decentralized technologies.  
I bought a bunch of Raspberry Pi computers and linked them together in what is known as an IPFS cluster
